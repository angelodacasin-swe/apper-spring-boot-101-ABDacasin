Spring Boot Notes for Day 2 has been integrated with Lab 1 submission: 
https://github.com/angelodacasin-swe/apper-spring-boot-101-ABDacasin/tree/main/day%202/account-service/account-service/src/main/java/com/apper


Additional Notes from readings:
nextID() -- commonly used a placeholder of values
@PathVariable annotation is used in Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications to extract values from the URI template


@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUserById(@PathVariable int id) {
        // Put code to fetch user details using the id
        // continue ...
    }
}

REMEMBER!!

CHECK on POSTMAN

POST - GET - DELETE - GET ALL - PUT
